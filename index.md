## Introduction

Hi, my name is Miska! I'm a twenty-year-old student from Espoo, Finland. I study linguistics in the University of Helsinki. I have a particular passion for dying and/or minority languages, especially Celtic and Uralic ones, and would love to eventually get to either document them or help their survival in some other ways. Besides languages, I'm also very interested in art and music, as well as traditional methods of textile handicraft (itâ€™s a lot more fun than it sounds like). I also really liked astronomy as a kid, but that was before I found out how much math that kind of stuff involves.
My greatest phobias include gorillas and ball lightning, while my biggest weaknesses are being unfairly short and sneezing every time I eat chocolate. Please don't use any of this information against me.
